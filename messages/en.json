      "title": "Preface",
      "challenge": "Language learning has always been a significant challenge. While mastering one or multiple languages can open up many career opportunities and life experiences, most people find it truly difficult to master a language.",
      "aiEra": "With the advent of AI, language learning efficiency has greatly improved. Various tools are much better compared to the pre-AI era, but I've noticed that current tools might only excel at one aspect without addressing the entire learning process, lacking core principles and design.",
      "bestProcess": "So, what is theoretically the best learning process? No one can really answer this question because there will always be better processes. However, in my view, there are several strong logical principles that must hold true:",
      "principles": [
        "Learn by sentences rather than individual words",
        "Review should be the core action",
        "Context recreation, recalling the scene where sentences appeared",
        "Streamlined process without distracting non-core features"
      ],
      "creation": "I couldn't find any software in the market that adheres to these basic principles, so I created Bunn. Bunn's design is centered around these points, aiming to create an elegant and complete language learning system."
    },
    "core": {
      "title": "Making Sentences the Core",
      "description": "It's now widely accepted that learning language through sentences is far more efficient than learning through individual words.",
      "gap": "Unfortunately, there's a lack of language learning tools truly built around sentences. While there are many excellent language learning applications, none provide a complete, elegant, and efficient learning process.",
      "origin": "That's why I created Bunn, which means \"sentence\" in Japanese. Bunn's core approach is reviewing sentences with context.",
      "features": "After entering a sentence, you immediately get accurate translations and kana annotations, practice shadow reading, and do dictation. You can also highlight unfamiliar words to add them to your vocabulary list, establishing connections between words and their usage contexts.",
      "inputMethods": "Put the video you want to watch into Bunn, and you only need one click to input the current subtitles of the video.",
      "methods": {
        "subtitles": "Get subtitle phrases from YouTube/Netflix videos",
        "copy": "Directly copy Japanese sentences from websites",
        "picture": "In the future, Bunn will support image recognition, allowing you to upload images containing Japanese text, with Bunn identifying all Japanese sentences for you to select which ones to upload."
      },
      "future": "In the future, we'll also support image input, allowing you to upload images containing Japanese text. Bunn will identify all Japanese sentences and let you choose which ones to review.",
      "demo": {
        "intro": "Here's how a sentence memory card looks:",
        "shadow": "Shadow Reading - Repeat after the audio to improve pronunciation",
        "dictation": "Dictation - Test if you can roughly remember the sentence"
      }
    },
    "review": {
      "title": "Review Like Browsing a Collection",
      "description": "Another core logic of Bunn is review. We all know repetition is necessary for memory, but often we're reluctant to review what we've learned.",
      "reason": "A key reason for this reluctance is that it's not engaging enough - your recorded content lacks interactivity and context, or the platform distracts you with other new content.",
      "solution": "These issues don't exist in Bunn. Bunn won't push any distracting content - everything is what you've input yourself, like anime you've watched, technical articles you've read, or interesting news you've seen. This ensures you're interested in or at least genuinely care about the content you're reviewing.",
      "interaction": "Plus, you can interact with each sentence - view context, practice shadow reading, and do dictation. These interactive actions make reviewing as engaging as browsing through your personal collection."
    },
    "context": {
      "title": "Context Recreation",
      "intro": "Think about how we mastered our native language. Many of us often mentally simulate scenarios - what we would say to others and how they might respond. The language used in these scenarios is what we absolutely remember.",
      "importance": "While it's hard to remember language elements in isolation, it's easy to remember contexts. Once we grasp the connection between context and expressions, we're more likely to remember those expressions. Sentences provide context for words, and sentences themselves exist within larger contexts.",
      "feature": "Bunn will record the location of all the sentences you input, and with one click you can go back to the corresponding position in the video to watch that animation segment again. I believe this is the most effective way to review."
    },
    "getStarted": {
      "title": "How to Get Japanese Sentences with Context",

        "intro": "I personally recommend <channel>Mary's YouTube channel</channel> for these reasons:",
        "reasons": [
          "Perfect sentence breaks with built-in subtitles",
          "Seamless shadow reading experience when used with our extension and app",

      "normal": "First, forgetting is completely normal. Everyone forgets a large portion of what they learn - that's just how our brains work.",
      "key": "The key is to be selective: only input sentences you find interesting or important. If you truly find certain content interesting or important, you'll naturally be more willing to spend time on:",

      "title": "How to Learn Japanese with YouTube in 2025: A Complete, Realistic Guide",
      "excerpt": "YouTube can absolutely help you learn Japanese — but only if you stop \"just watching\" and start turning videos into structured practice. This guide shows a realistic, step-by-step way to use subtitles, shadowing, and review to learn from the videos you already love.",
      "intro": "If you’ve ever told yourself “I’m totally learning Japanese, I watch a lot of anime,” you’re not alone.\nAnd if you’ve ever opened a textbook, did two chapters, and then quietly went back to YouTube, you’re also not alone.\n\nThe good news: in 2025, learning Japanese with YouTube is absolutely possible.\nThe bad news: just watching YouTube will not get you there.\n\nThis article shows you a realistic, step-by-step way to turn any YouTube video into a structured Japanese lesson — using subtitles, shadowing, and spaced repetition. We’ll also see where a tool like Bunn (bunn.ink) fits in, without pretending it’s magic.",
      "part1_title": "Why YouTube Is the Best Source of Real Japanese",
      "part1_content": "Textbooks are great at one thing: being out of date.\n\nYouTube, on the other hand, gives you:\n\n- Real language, not textbook language\nYou hear the way people actually speak: fillers, sentence endings, casual forms, slang, hesitation — the things that never make it into polite dialogues.\n\n- Endless variety of content\nVlogs, news, gaming, tech, anime analysis, cooking, JLPT prep, street interviews. Whatever you like in your native language, there’s probably a Japanese version of it.\n\n- Fresh and relevant input\nYou can watch videos about events that happened yesterday, not fake conversations about “Ken buying a CD at a record store”.\n\n- Native-level pronunciation and rhythm\nIf your goal is natural listening and speaking, you want hours of exposure to real voices, not just slow and over-articulated audio tracks.\n\nAll of this makes YouTube a perfect input source.\nBut as anyone who has “studied Japanese” while letting the autoplay algorithm take over knows: input without structure turns into background noise very quickly.",
      "part2_title": "Why “Just Watching YouTube” Doesn’t Work",
      "part2_content": "If YouTube alone could make you fluent, half the internet would be speaking perfect Japanese by now.\n\nThere are three main reasons “just watching” fails:\n\n**Problem 1: Passive Watching**\nYou click one video. You understand a bit. You click another. Repeat for an hour.\nYou feel like you’re studying, but you never replay the same sentence several times, you never check what was actually said, and you never test yourself on what you just heard.\nYour brain treats it like entertainment, not learning.\n\n**Problem 2: Subtitle Chaos**\nMany serious learners get stuck on subtitles:\n- The video has no Japanese subtitles at all.\n- It only has translated subtitles in another language.\n- Auto-generated subtitles are full of errors, missing particles, and wrong kanji.\n- You can’t easily pause and study line by line.\nSo you end up guessing, which is fun, but not efficient.\n\n**Problem 3: No Review System**\nEven if you catch a cool phrase or interesting word, you don’t write it down, or you write it down and never see it again.\nWithout a simple way to save and revisit vocabulary and sentences, your progress is slower than it should be. You keep rediscovering the same words and thinking, “I’ve seen this before…” — and you probably have.",
      "part3_title": "The Right Approach: Turn Any Video into a Japanese Lesson",
      "part3_content": "Now for the part that actually works.\nHere’s a realistic workflow to learn Japanese with YouTube in 2025.\n\nWe’ll assume you’re using a tool like Bunn (bunn.ink) that can:\n- Import Japanese and English subtitles from YouTube\n- Split the video into sentence-level segments\n- Let you loop, slow down, and shadow specific lines\n- Help you review vocabulary you mark as important\n\nYou can do some of this manually of course, but life is short.\n\n**Step 0: Choose the Right Video**\nNot every video is a good learning video, especially if you’re below N2.\nLook for clear audio, Japanese subtitles, content you genuinely care about, and a reasonable length (5–20 minutes is ideal).\n\n**Step 1: Get Accurate Japanese Subtitles**\nThis is the foundation: no reliable subtitles, no precise learning.\nUse videos with official Japanese subtitles when possible, and use tools like Bunn to fetch and align Japanese (and optionally English) subtitles.\n\n**Step 2: Do a “Global Understanding” Watch**\nBefore dissecting the video, watch it once all the way through with Japanese subtitles. Don’t pause or rewind; just get a general sense of the topic and tone.\n\n**Step 3: Study Sentence by Sentence**\nFor each line: listen once without looking, then listen while reading Japanese, and only then check the translation if needed. In Bunn, this looks like one sentence on screen with aligned JP/EN subtitles and instant replay.\n\n**Step 4: Shadow the Audio**\nAfter you understand a line, speak along with the audio, matching rhythm and intonation. Loop and slow-down features in Bunn make this much easier.\n\n**Step 5: Save Key Vocabulary and Phrases**\nDon’t save everything — only what is useful and recurring. Mark words and lines in Bunn as \"worth learning\" so you can review them later in context.\n\n**Step 6: Build a Simple Weekly Routine**\nAim for 3–5 sessions per week, 30–45 minutes each: a bit of global watching, a focused sentence-by-sentence section, shadowing, and short review.",
      "part4_title": "A 30-Minute Study Session You Can Copy",
      "part4_content": "Here’s a simple 30-minute session template using a 7–10 minute Japanese vlog with subtitles and Bunn to manage subtitles and sentences.\n\n0–5 minutes: Watch the whole video once with Japanese subtitles, no pausing.\n5–15 minutes: Go through the first 1–2 minutes sentence by sentence: listen, read Japanese, then (optionally) check English.\n15–25 minutes: Shadow 5–10 key sentences several times each.\n25–30 minutes: Save 5–10 key phrases you want to remember.\n\nThe pattern is always: whole video → parts → voice → memory.\nInstead of letting the recommendation algorithm run until you feel tired, you direct your attention and energy on a small number of sentences you truly learn.",
      "part5_title": "Different Ways to Use YouTube for Japanese",
      "part5_content": "Not all YouTube-based study methods are equal.\n\nJust watching YouTube is easy and fun, but gives you almost no repetition, no clear progress, and you forget most new words.\nManual note-taking with pausing gives you full control, but is high-friction: constant pausing, rewinding, and typing Japanese by hand.\n\nA structured tool like Bunn sits in the middle:\n- Sentence-level control and synced subtitles\n- Built-in looping, slowing down, and shadowing\n- An easy way to save phrases for later review\n\nThe point isn’t that you must use Bunn; the point is that the more boring logistics you offload to a tool, the more brainspace you have left for actual Japanese.",
      "part6_title": "Can Beginners Really Start with YouTube?",
      "part6_content": "Short answer: yes, but not with any random video.\n\nFor absolute beginners, start with channels designed for learners, easy Japanese content, or clear anime clips with good subtitles. Focus on recognizing basic patterns and a small number of high-frequency phrases.\n\nBunn helps beginners by showing Japanese and English side by side, letting you replay the same line until it stops sounding like noise, and giving you a safe place to pause and think without fighting the YouTube UI.\n\nIt is a bit harder than textbook dialogues, but far more motivating, because you’re studying content you genuinely like.",
      "part7_title": "Putting It All Together",
      "part7_content": "Learning Japanese with YouTube in 2025 is no longer just a vague idea — it’s a concrete workflow.\n\nIn short:\n1. Choose the right video with clear audio and Japanese subtitles.\n2. Import it into a tool that gives you sentence-level control (like Bunn).\n3. Watch globally first, then study locally, line by line.\n4. Shadow key sentences until your mouth catches up with your ears.\n5. Save and review only what matters, in context.\n6. Repeat this routine a few times a week.\n\nIf you’re already spending time on YouTube, you don’t need to change your life to start learning Japanese with it — you just need to turn random watching into intentional practice.\nBunn is designed to help with the subtitles, looping, and remembering, turning any YouTube video into an interactive Japanese lesson without replacing the content you already love.",
      "conclusion": "If you want to turn your YouTube time into real Japanese progress, try loading one of your favorite videos into Bunn and following the workflow from this guide. Start small, be consistent, and let real Japanese from real videos become your main teacher.",
